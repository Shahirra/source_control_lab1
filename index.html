<!-- 1. Purpose of a Git Repository

A Git repository tracks changes in your project files.
For front-end developers:

Keeps a history of versions (HTML, CSS, JS).

Makes it easy to roll back if something breaks.

Helps collaborate with others. -->

<!-- 2. Tracked vs Untracked Files

Tracked files → Git is monitoring them (e.g., your index.html after git add).

Untracked files → Git doesn’t know about them yet. (after git init) -->

<!-- 3. Importance of .gitignore

Some files/folders (like node_modules/) are:

Huge in size.

Can be regenerated from package.json.

Not needed in Git history.
.gitignore ensures your repo stays clean and lightweight. -->


<!-- 4. Benefit of Viewing History

By viewing history, a developer can:

See what changes were made and why.

Debug issues (e.g., find which commit broke the layout).

Revert to a stable version if needed. -->


<!-- 5. Role of GitHub & GitHub Pages

GitHub: A remote hosting service for your Git repository. Makes collaboration and backup easier.

GitHub Pages: Turns your static front-end project into a live website, so you (and others) can view it online instantly. -->
